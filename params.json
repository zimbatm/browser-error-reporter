{"name":"Browser error reporter","body":"Browser error reporter\r\n======================\r\n\r\nAre you like me, wondering how many underported client errors are just\r\nhidden from us ? Well.. you can stop being in the dark today !\r\n\r\nWith just a couple of steps, you will start getting all these nasty\r\nerrors that you never saw because who tests his site in IE anymore ?\r\n\r\nInstall that thing\r\n==================\r\n\r\n1: Insert the script as early as possible in your page to not miss any\r\n   errors. Eg:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<!doctype html>\r\n<html>\r\n  <head>\r\n    <meta charset=utf-8>\r\n    <script src=\"path/to/browser-error-reporter.js\"></script>\r\n    ...\r\n```\r\n\r\n2: Change your webapp to accept POST requests on the \"/error_report\"\r\n   end-point. For example in Rails, I use this kind of controller to\r\n   forward the errors to [Airbrake](http://airbrakeapp.com/).\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n# app/controllers/failing_controller.rb\r\nclass FailingController < ApplicationController\r\n  def index\r\n    # We should get message, file and line parameters from the\r\n    # JavaScript client\r\n    raise params[:message] || \"this page should fail!\"\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n\r\n# in config/routes.rb:\r\npost '/report_error' => 'failing#index'\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen the controller raises an exception, airbreak catches it an forwards\r\nit to their server, where all exceptions are nicely categorized.\r\n\r\n(Examples for other kind of backends are welcome)\r\n\r\n3: Profit !\r\n\r\nIf you have any issues, just add it to the [bug tracker](https://github.com/zimbatm/browser-error-reporter/issues) and I'll take a\r\nlook.\r\n\r\nStatus\r\n======\r\n\r\nThis script is actually running on [PandaStream](http://www.pandastream.com) and has helped me find a couple of unknown JavaScript issues. I'm still not 100% confident in it but it's good enough that it doesn't hurt.\r\n\r\nDesign\r\n======\r\n\r\nThe JavaScript has no external dependencies and is kept as small as\r\npossible. This to avoid the error reporter having errors himself.\r\n\r\nThe \"/error_report\" is hard-coded to avoid another possible cause of\r\nerror. We're trying to collect errors so it's quite crucial to not\r\nintroduce our own issues. If you don't like the path of the end-point,\r\nyou'll need to change it by hand. Search for \"/report_error\" in the script\r\nand replace it to your liking !\r\n\r\nLicence: MIT\r\n\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n  zimbatm\r\n","tagline":"Be notified of all those nasty client errors","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
